A starting kit for training and establishing in vivo electrophysiology, intracranial pharmacology, and optogenetics

In accordance with the three R principles of research, animal usage should be limited as much as possible. Especially for the training of entry-level scientists in surgical techniques underlying opto- and electrophysiology, alternative training tools are required before moving on to live animals. We have developed a cost-effective rat brain model for training a wide range of surgical techniques, including, but not limited to optogenetics, electrophysiology, and intracranial pharmacological treatments.
